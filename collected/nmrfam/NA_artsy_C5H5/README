*** 3 extra analysis scripts are included:
get_jch.py
fit.com
couplings.com

*** Run the following scripts in order (after minor edits):

*** conversion (fid.com):
use NMRPipe 'bruker' command to generate fid.com

- carrier is on water (4.773p @ 25C)
- set indirect axis complex
- double no. of real/complex points

*** ft (edit ft.com)

ft.com - put phase corrections

*** peak pick the the reference spectrum (plane z=1, the more intense of the two), assign it and save it as 'ass.tab'

*** run these as is:

fit.com

***
- edit couplings.com to update the noise level of the reference spectrum (from nmrDraw) and run it:
couplings.com
- will output the couplings as jdC5H5.dat

*** check largest and smallest RDC:
sort -n -k2 jdC5H5.dat
