*** 3 extra analysis scripts are included:
get_jnh.py
fit.com
couplings.com

*** Run the following scripts in order (after minor edits):

*** conversion (fid.com):
use NMRPipe 'bruker' command to generate fid.com

- carrier is at 12.2 ppm
- set indirect axis complex
- double no. of real/complex points

*** ft (edit ft.com)
ft.com - put phase corrections

*** peak pick the the reference spectrum (plane z=1, the more intense of the two), assign it and save it as:
ass.tab

*** run these 2 scripts:
fit.com

***
- edit couplings.com to update the noise level of the reference spectrum (from nmrDraw) and run it:
couplings.com

- will output the couplings as jnh.dat
